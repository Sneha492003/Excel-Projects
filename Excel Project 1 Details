Project Title: Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard

Description:
This project utilizes Microsoft Excel to analyze bike buyer data, 
focusing on key attributes like Marital Status, Gender, and Income. 
By creating a pivot table, insights into bike sales trends are obtained, 
particularly regarding the count of purchased bikes across different 
demographics. A dynamic dashboard is developed, featuring average income 
and the count of purchased bikes as primary metrics. This dashboard aids 
in visualizing sales patterns and identifying target demographics for marketing 
strategies

Key Steps:

Data Exploration: Exploring the bike buyer dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Pivot Table Creation: Constructing a pivot table to analyze the count of purchased bikes, organized by various attributes such as Marital Status, Gender, and Education.
Dashboard Development: Creating a dynamic dashboard showcasing key metrics like average income and count of purchased bikes. Visualizations such as charts and graphs provide a comprehensive overview of bike sales trends.
Insight Generation: Extracting insights from the dashboard to identify potential target demographics and inform marketing strategies.

Usage:
The Excel-based bike sales analysis serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders involved in bike sales and marketing. Insights derived from the dashboard aid in understanding customer demographics, optimizing sales strategies, 
and enhancing overall business performance.

Future Directions:
